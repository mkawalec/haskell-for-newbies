- Strong static typing
- Most of the cool stuff introduced through typeclasses (think function
    overloading)
- Composition over inheritance
- Has mutable values
- Haskell has a first-class interpreter, `ghci`
- If you see a command line prompt in the following, it will most likely
    come from ghci
- Awesome threads

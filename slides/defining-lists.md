##  defining lists

Let's define a list

    let aList = [4,2,5,1]

    > aList !! 2
    5

    > sort aList
    [1,2,4,5]

    > [1, "foobar"]
	No instance for (Num [Char]) arising from the literal ‘1’
	In the expression: 1
	In the expression: [1, "foobar"]
	In an equation for ‘it’: it = [1, "foobar"]

##  summary

- Haskell makes encapsulating complexity straightforward
- Data operations are bound to data types
- Side effects are explicit, so we can see which part of our program
    sends the missiles
- Refactoring is (almost) a joy
- If it compiles it runs
- No need to write boring tests
- It's fast if you want it to be
